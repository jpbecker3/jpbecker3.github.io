About Me
  My Interests
    - I enjoy reading mystery and fantasy books in my free time. I also enjoy taking my dog on trails in the area. 
  Websites I recommend
    - The Buffalo Bills Football Team Website: https://www.buffalobills.com/
        - I find this website interesting as I'm a very big Buffalo fan and like to stay up to date on the team. 
    - National Weather Service For My Area: https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?CityName=Apex&state=NC&site=RAH&lat=35.7258&lon=-78.845
        - I frequently check the national weather service updates for my area especially with all the hurricanes heading this way
